### Executive summary
- A social media platform that endorses ‘closing the sugar gap’. The application’s inspiration is derived by the fact that some people are lactose intolerant, but also still love desserts. There are a lot of desserts that some people are not aware of just because of their dietary limitations. This app is basically a bridge for people who love desserts and want to learn or post about different sweets from either around their location or different locations that people have visited. People can post the location(s) of the shop, write reviews, and upload pictures. A filter can be added in which people with different dietary needs can apply, so that everyone can be a part of the rush!
 
- Bringing awareness to different kinds of desserts that are available, and for everyone. 
To help people with dietary needs find desserts within their neighborhood.  For example, people who are lactose intolerant can filter out desserts with dairy and find the location on where they are sold.

- There are some apps that are available that are similar but not the same. For example, Instagram, you can post pictures of your food, or anything else. However, in this application, it would be strictly for desserts. A user can start off with just cakes, and then add more categories.

- It is different because it is focused primarily on desserts and informing people about different kinds of desserts that are out there and suitable for their diet.

### User-types of Application

### User Stories
